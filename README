OVERVIEW:

 Reads a hash file which contains glucose reading for a patient.
 Allows a heath care professional access a patients glucose readings.


INCLUDED FILES:

 PatientDriver.java - The driver class that a patient need to use
 ProfessionalMain.java - The driver class that the health care professional needs to use
 ReadingsController.java - The class that represents a patient and their glucose readings
 ReadingModel.java - The class that represent a single glucose reading
 Parser.java - The file that parses a simple hash containing the glucose readings
 README - this file

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 To run as a patient:
 $ javac PatientDriver.java
 $ java PatientDriver

 to run as a health care professional:
 $ javac ProfessionalMain.java
 $ java ProfessionalMain


 You will be asked a series of input that are needed for the program to run
 correctly.

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 The patient first needs to run the program since they are the one giving a
 health care professionals access to their glucose readings.  The patient driver
 class is expecting the glucose reading hash files in the correct format and named
 with their first and last name with no spaces in between.  Then after creating a
 ReadingsController object the patient is asked for which health care professional they
 want to share the readings.  After choosing their health care professional the
 program writes the ReadingsController object to a file.

 The health care professional can run the Professional driver class to view their
 patients glucose readings.  The driver class asks what the name pf the health care
 professional is and which patient they want to view the glucose reading for. After
 if the health care professional has permission the view the patients glucose
 readings, they get alerts for the low and high glucose readings.

 I wrote the program fairly complex and would need to talk more about the program
 to fully explain my design choices.  The project uses the patients name to figure
 out the file names so the patient name needs to be consistent between runs.
